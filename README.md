The format of the record id argument in the heap file update and delete will be pageid:slot.
The code for heap file operations, and the rowstore select should be functional, however due to the heap implementation not working it was unable to be tested.
The file heapselect.cc is the executable for the rowstore select and the file select.cc is function for both select2 and select3 depending on the number of arguments.
The code that we have committed for colstore is functional, on its own given implementations of library.cc that are implemented in a simpler format. Since the majority of the of the experiments relied on the heap store we were unable to implement the experiments. Please, look over the code for partial marks. Thank you for your time.
